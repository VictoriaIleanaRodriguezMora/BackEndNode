> Instruction: Make a server project based on node.js that uses the express module and implements the following endpoints on port 8080:

- Route get '/products' returns an array with all the products, which are available on the server.

- Route get '/product Random' returns a product chosen at random from all available products on the server

- Includes a text file "products.txt", and use the Container Class, from latest challenge to access the data saves on the server


- I had to do a synchronous function syncGetFile(). Because the function getAll, return a promise. And I can't work with it. 

- First native route management in node.js.

- The principal route indicates the available routes in the app.
